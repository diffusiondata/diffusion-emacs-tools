Diffusion Emacs Tools
=====================

# diffusion-log-mode

A simple Emacs mode for viewing Diffusion log files.

The mode provides syntax highlighting. It is derived from the standard
`view-mode`, and inherits useful key-bindings. Once the mode is
enabled, type 'h' for full documentation.

diffusion-log-mode is compatible with log files produced by Diffusion
4.6 and later.

## Colors

Colors can be changed using customize (`M-x customize-face`).

The default colors are designed for a dark background, e.g. the
`solarized-dark` theme.
